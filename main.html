    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that helps us analyze the efficiency of algorithms. It measures how the execution time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. An algorithm is considered efficient if it has a low time complexity, meaning it can handle larger inputs without significantly increasing the time it takes to execute.</p>
    <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory space an algorithm uses to solve a problem. It's essential to ensure that algorithms don't consume excessive memory, especially when dealing with large datasets. One common way to measure space complexity is by using big O notation, denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> analysis helps us understand how an algorithm's memory requirements scale with input size.</p>
