    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm. O(1) is efficient the fastest runtime</p>
    <p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size.</p>
